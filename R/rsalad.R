#' A mix of useful R functions that are good for you
#'
#' This package provides a collection of useful R functions that
#' I've found myself reusing often.  While there isn't a common specific theme
#' to all these functions, they are mostly either for manipulating data frames
#' or improving ggplot2 plots.
