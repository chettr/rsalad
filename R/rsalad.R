#' A mix of commonly useful R functions, mostly for data.frames and ggplot2
#'
#' This package provides a collection of useful R functions that I've found
#' myself reusing often in many different projects.  While there isn't a
#' common specific theme to all these functions, they are mostly either for
#' manipulating data frames or improving ggplot2 plots.
