Version: 0.0.0.9002
Authors@R: "Dean Attali <daattali@gmail.com> [aut, cre]"
Description: This package provides a collection of useful R functions that
    I've found myself reusing often in many different projects.  While there
    isn't a common specific theme to all these functions, they are mostly
    either for manipulating data frames or improving ggplot2 plots.
